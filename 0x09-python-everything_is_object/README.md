# PYTHON - Everything is Object

This project deals with object instantiation in Python. Object instantiation in Python is the process of creating a new instance of a class. In other words, it's the process of creating an object based on a blueprint defined by a class.

To instantiate an object, you first need to define a class. A class is a blueprint that defines the properties and behaviors of objects that are based on that class. Once you have defined a class, you can create one or more objects based on that class by using the class name followed by parentheses.

Object instantiation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, and it allows you to create multiple instances of a class with different attribute values.
The project involved a series of quiz-like questions. The answers are provided in single-line .txt files.
