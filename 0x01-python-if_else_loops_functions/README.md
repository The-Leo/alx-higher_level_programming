# PYTHON if/else, loops, functions
This project utilizes skills gained in Python programming by utilizing conditionals and loops in Python by using: 
* if, 
* if ... else, 
* break, 
* continue, 
* pass, and 
* range statements with while and for loops. 

Within these files, I wrote my own Python functions while learning about scope of variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.
