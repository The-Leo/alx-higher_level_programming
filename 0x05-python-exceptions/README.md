# PYTHON - EXCEPTIONS
In this project, I learnt about handling errors and exceptions in Python with try and except.
I delved into the following concepts:

* What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
* What are exceptions and how to use them
* When do we need to use exceptions
* How to correctly handle an exception
* What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
* How to raise a builtin exception
* When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception
