# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping
An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects that are more commonly used in application code.
In this project, I linked two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

In the first part, I used the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and executed my SQL queries.

In the second part, I used the module SQLAlchemy, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

## General Objectives of the Project
* How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
* How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* What ORM means
* How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
* How to create a Python Virtual Environment
