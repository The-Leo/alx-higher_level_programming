## How to fetch internet resources with the Python package urllib
To fetch internet resources using the Python package urllib, you can use the urllib.request module, which provides classes and functions for making HTTP requests and handling responses. 

To decode the body of an HTTP response obtained using urllib and convert it from bytes to a string, you can use the .decode() method with the appropriate character encoding. Most web content uses the UTF-8 character encoding, so you'll often use that encoding for decoding
