# PYTHON - More Classes and Objects

In this project, I continued to practice object-oriented programming in Python. I learned about class methods, static methods, class vs instance attributes, and how to use the special __str__ and __repr__ methods.

## TASKS:

### 0. Simple rectangle
Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
You are not allowed to import any module

### 1. Real definition of a rectangle
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 0-rectangle.py)

Private instance attribute: width:
property def width(self): to retrieve it
property setter def width(self, value): to set it:
width must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message width must be an integer
if width is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message width must be >= 0
Private instance attribute: height:
property def height(self): to retrieve it
property setter def height(self, value): to set it:
height must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message height must be an integer
if height is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message height must be >= 0
Instantiation with optional width and height: def __init__(self, width=0, height=0):
You are not allowed to import any module
